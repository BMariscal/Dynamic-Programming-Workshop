# Dynamic programming workshop
This repository contains materials for a workshop on dynamic programming given at the Recurse Center on October 6, 2016. It includes source code for all examples discussed, the presentation document, and most importantly, a list of resources / tips in this readme.

## Resources for learning and practicing
In terms of learning the ideas and theory behind dynamic programming, I'd like to recommend
the lectures in part 2 of the [Stanford Algorithms course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithm-design-analysis-2).
You can skip right to the dynamic programming lectures, they're in week 3. A lot of the materials for
this workshop were drawn from these lectures so some things will be familiar.

Besides that, I'd recommend 2 things:

1. Practicing lots of problems in the dynamic programming category on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/tag/dynamic-programming/)
2. Searching for other videos / explanations of some of the more "classic" DP algorithms. A couple I'd recommend learning about are:
  * The Coin Change problem
  * String edit distance (helps you solve a whole class of string matching problems, like RegEx matching, etc. I found [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q2IEIY2pDU) video and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAVGRWSryGo) video to be really helpful, both from a Coursera course on gene sequencing)
  * The Knapsack problem (covered in the workshop)
  * The Longest Common Subsequence algorithm

## Curated practice problems
Here I've listed some of my favorite dynamic programming problems on leetcode (and a couple from Project Euler), ordered by difficulty.

#### Easier problems
These are pretty similar to the ones we did in workshop (with 1 dimension)  
1. [Climbing stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/) (similar to a problem covered in workshop)  
2. [House robber](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/) (covered in workshop)  
3. [Stock selling](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/) (a variant on classic DP principles)  
4. [Max sum subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/) (a little more difficult)  

#### Medium-ish problems
I tried to include some 2 dimensional problems here, as well as more complex string / sequence problems.  
1. [Subsequence check](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/) (First introduction to string comparison dynamic programming)  
2. [Longest wiggle subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/wiggle-subsequence/) (More sequence/subsequence practice)  
3. [Min path sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-path-sum/) (An introduction to (usually contrived) pathfinding DP problems)  
4. [More pathfinding](https://projecteuler.net/problem=82) (Slightly harder pathfinding)  
5. [Coin change](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/) (Another classic)  
6. [Min perfect square sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/perfect-squares/) (Good 2d problem)  

#### Hard problems
An assortment of problems of the more difficult variety.  
1. [More stock buying](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iii/) (A tough variation to the max profit problem)  
2. [Count unique BSTs](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-binary-search-trees/) (No comment)  
3. [Edit distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/) (Would recommend watching the videos listed above for this one. Maybe give it a shot though?)  
4. [Wildcard / regex matching](https://leetcode.com/problems/wildcard-matching/) (Can be solved with dynamic programming, but I think there are more efficient non-DP solutions)  

For any of these problems, I would highly recommend looking at the discussion forum on Leetcode once you've finished your solution. I've learned more from people on there than most other sources combined.
